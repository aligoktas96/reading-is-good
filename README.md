## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes:

- I tried to provide consistency with the SAGA method.
- I tried to prevent the stock from falling to a negative number by marking the stock column in the product table as unsigned.
- I did all the tasks except Authentication. I could not do the authentication task as I could not complete it in time.
